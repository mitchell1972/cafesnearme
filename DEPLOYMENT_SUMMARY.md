# Vercel Deployment Summary

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed

1. **Environment Variables Setup**
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: team_OGm4og46CTHI1maed040Cl3q
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: prj_zm14mAA9uw0whWHIv67maKYArTiJ
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`: B3IhRl1dbDOlmjBHsX4hD8Pu
   - All variables are properly set in `.env` file

2. **Database Configuration**
   - `DATABASE_URL` is configured on Vercel with Neon PostgreSQL
   - Connection string: postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_17OkXbGimsRj@ep-young-moon-abhzysd7-pooler.eu-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require

3. **Project Linking**
   - Project successfully linked to Vercel
   - Organization: mitchells-projects-99699068
   - Project: cafesnearme

4. **Build Script Updates**
   - Updated `build.sh` to properly handle Vercel environment
   - Script now correctly detects Vercel environment and generates Prisma client

## ‚ùå Current Issue

The deployment is failing during the build phase with "Export of Next.js app failed" error. This appears to be happening consistently across multiple deployment attempts.

## üìã Deployment Scripts Created

1. **deploy-to-vercel.sh** - Full deployment with metadata
2. **deploy-simple.sh** - Simplified deployment with project linking
3. **build.sh** - Updated to handle Vercel environment properly

## üîç Troubleshooting Steps Taken

1. Verified all environment variables are set correctly
2. Confirmed DATABASE_URL is configured on Vercel
3. Updated build script to handle Vercel environment
4. Attempted multiple deployments with different approaches

## üöÄ How to Deploy

### Using the CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Load environment variables and deploy
source .env && npx vercel --prod --token $VERCEL_TOKEN --yes
```

### Using the deployment script
```bash
./deploy-simple.sh
```

### Using the original command format
```bash
source .env
npx vercel@25.1.0 --prod \
  -t $VERCEL_TOKEN \
  -m githubCommitSha=06a1d46d9b7cb061a494750da3a7974e12c763d7 \
  -m githubCommitAuthorName=mitchell1972 \
  -m githubCommitAuthorLogin=mitchell1972 \
  -m githubDeployment=1 \
  -m githubOrg=mitchell1972 \
  -m githubRepo=cafesnearme \
  -m githubCommitOrg=mitchell1972 \
  -m githubCommitRepo=cafesnearme \
  -m githubCommitMessage="fix: make build script compatible with local and Vercel environments" \
  -m githubCommitRef=main
```

## üìù Next Steps

The deployment infrastructure is properly configured, but the build is failing on Vercel. The issue appears to be related to the Next.js export process. You may need to:

1. Check the Vercel dashboard for detailed build logs
2. Verify that all required environment variables are available during build time
3. Consider if there are any issues with static generation that might be causing the export to fail

## üìä Deployment History

- Multiple failed deployments in the last 3 hours
- Last successful deployment was 4 hours ago
- All recent failures show "Export of Next.js app failed" error
